wpcf7-email-verification
========================

Extends Contact Form 7 to allow for email addresses to be verified.

This is done by not sending the form's content immediately as per usual, but first getting the user to click on a link sent to his email address to verify ownership of the email entered. Once done, the submission gets sent through.

NOTE: This plugin is not ready for use; it's not fully functional and under constant development.

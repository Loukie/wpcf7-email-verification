wpcf7-email-verification
========================

Extends Contact Form 7 to allow for email addresses to be verified. This functionality is particularly useful for legalese reasons, by verifying a person's identity (the ownership of their email address).

When this plugin is activated, on a form submission..

1) The form submission does not get sent but instead saved temporarily.
2) The sender gets sent an email address with a link to click to confirm their email address.
3) Once the link is clicked, the form gets sent as per usual for CF7 functionality.
